# odin-recipes
My first project with The Odin Project! This project was assigned to me at the end of the "HTML Foundations" section of TOP.

My thoughts after completing the project
Honestly, this was really fun! Although it wasn't complex or anything, this project covered everything I've seen in the "HTML Foundations" section. I also added a return button to the recipes as well :)
