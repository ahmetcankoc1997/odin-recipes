    <h1>One Pot Pasta</h1>
    <img src="onepotpasta.jpeg" alt="One Pot Pasta">
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>It's one of our most popular recipes and for good reason. 
    This is our original one-pot pasta recipe, inspired by a dish one of our food editors ate in Puglia, Italy. 
    All the ingredients cook together in a straight-sided skillet, you don’t even need to boil water first—and it's on the table in just 20 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces linguine</li>
        <li>12 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or quartered if large</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and water in a large straight-sided skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil mixture, stirring and turning pasta frequently with tongs, until pasta is al dente and water has nearly evaporated, about 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, divide among 4 bowls, and garnish with basil. Serve with oil and Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
